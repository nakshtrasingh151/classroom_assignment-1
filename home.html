                <p style="font-size: large;">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which 
                    is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs 
                    by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). 
                    Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before 
                    it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match 
                    referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

                <p style="font-size: large;">Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing 
                    one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) 
                    in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a 
                    backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. 
                    A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, 
                    timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.

                <p style="font-size: large;">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. 
                    Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
                    Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); 
                    gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; 
                    rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of football are k
                    nown as football codes.

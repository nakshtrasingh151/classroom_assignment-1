                <strong>STALWART COACHING-- HOW TO BE BRAVE AS A BASKETBALL COACH</strong><br>
                <p>A stalwart basketball coach is brave in his or her mind and also brave with his or her words. A stalwart coach is a loyal coach and never throws players under the proverbial bus of critique or blame. A stalwart coach is a self-disciplined coach who always reframes the deficits into opportunities.

                    When you are learning to ride a motorcycle, you have to look past the turn in the road. Focusing on the turn will cause you to crash. Looking past the curve keeps your focus on where you want to go. The same is true in coaching.

                <strong>Pro Skills Basketball Return to Play Plan</strong><br>
                <p>No one is more excited to return to play than us here at Pro Skills Basketball, but we also understand it is vital that we do so in a slow, conscious, and safe manner.

                    With that in mind, and with the oversight of medical experts, we have created and are launching our Pro Skills Basketball “Return to Play Plan“, an 8-page plan that includes 4 phases tied to federal, state, and county guidelines.
                    
                    Phase 1 of this plan will launch May 25th and will include on-court small-group workouts (see safety precautions below), virtual training, virtual camps, and virtual shooting tournaments.

                <strong>GROWING LEADERS IN OUR YOUTH BASKETBALL CAMPS</strong><br>
                <p>In basketball, success depends on the quality of leadership that you find on each team. I’m not just talking about the coach and the way he runs his squad — to be an effective player you must be a proficient leader. There shouldn’t just be one leader on your team. In fact, every player should be a leader in their own right. At the end of the day, all truly great basketball players are great leaders, too.

                <strong>After The Last Dance: An oral history of the 1998-99 Chicago Bulls</strong><br>
                <p>After winning six championships in eight seasons, the Chicago Bulls’ dynastic run came to an end in the summer of 1998. Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler and Luc Longley were replaced. Only six players from the previous season returned in 1998-99. After totaling 62 wins (the most in the NBA) and capturing their third-straight title, the Bulls won just 13 games (the third-fewest in the NBA) in 1998-99, joining the 1969-70 Boston Celtics as the only defending champions to miss the playoffs. 

                    HoopsHype talked to several players from that Bulls squad and three writers who covered the team to discuss that difficult season, what it was like trying to fill such big shoes, the end of the dynasty and more. This story begins right where “The Last Dance” ends.

                <strong>Chikara Tanaka has best friend to thank for path from skateboarder to hopeful Olympic debut</strong><br>
                <p>TOKYO (Japan) - There is a certain smoothness that you see when watching Chikara Tanaka's flashy play on the court. Whether it's the no-look passes, the one-handed push shot, or the shifty crossovers, he just seems to understand the flow of it all. It might only be a coincidence, or maybe it is a by-product of Tanaka's past of controlling flow and style before basketball.

                    "I used to skateboard actually. I used to be a skateboarder," Tanaka admitted in an interview with "Sport Stars of Tomorrow," talking about how it was more of an accident that he started playing basketball.
                    
                    "In Japan, I was kind of tall, so my friends were like 'Come play basketball,' and I was like 'Nah, I don't want to.' And I had this really close friend, he was my best friend, he was on the team, and he told me just to come and play with him and have fun. I went to practice and just fell in love."
